\section{Conclusion} 
In this report I have detailed the implementation of a static
value analysis for a subset of the eBPF language, based on the principles of
abstract interpretation. The goal was to approximate the possible values of
registers and memory at each program point using an infinite interval domain.

The analysis was built upon the control-flow graphs generated by ebpf-tools.
The core of the implementation is a work-set algorithm designed to propagate
abstract states through the program. The algorithm incorporates a strategy of
widening to an infinite interval after a fixed number of iterations, followed
by a series of narrowing steps to refine the approximation. The implementation
successfully models the abstract semantics for a range of eBPF instructions.

The implementation was validated through a combination of unit tests for the
abstract domain operators and by manually verifying the output on some example
eBPF programs. These tests indicate that the implementation produces valid
output. 

Despite this, several areas for future work have been
mentioned, including optimizations and handling of more instructions. 

In conclusion, this project has successfully produced a functional, albeit
simplified, value analysis for eBPF.
