\section{Validation}
Validation of the implementation includes both unit tests\footnote{These
unit tests were created with the help of LLMs, where I then looked over to make
sure the test results made sense.} and the default programs provided by
eBPF-tools, where the output was simply checked by hand. Some programs with
load and store instructions were also created and checked by hand to make sure
that the implementation gave expected results.
